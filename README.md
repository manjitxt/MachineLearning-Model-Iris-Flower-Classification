Machine Learning Model : Iris Flower Classification
This project aims at building a machine learning model for the classification of The Iris Flower. The given dataset has three classes and model should be able to classify iris flowers into their respective classes.

The three classes of IRIS Flower Classification are as given below:
-Setosa
-Versicolor
-Virginica

The dataset for the project is available at Github: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv

Machine Learning algorithms used for classification in model:
•	Support vector machine
•	Logistic regression
•	k-nearest neighbors algorithm
•	Decision trees
•	Gausian naive bayes

The model is written(coded) in Python Programming Language using the following Python Libraries:
•	SciPy
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	Pandas
•	Sklearn

How to run:
Project can run in any python IDE. It has been initially tested on Google Colab Platform.
Model can accurately predict and classify the iris flower on the basis of sepal-length, sepal-width, petal-length, and petal-width
Model also serves as a general template of classification problem that can be used on for various datasets.
